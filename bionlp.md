## EVEX

EVEX is a text mining resource built on top of PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full texts. It contains over 40 million bio-molecular events among more than 76 million automatically extracted gene/protein name mentions.

The EVEX dataset is the result of running the [Turku Event Extraction System](http://jbjorne.github.com/TEES/) together with [BANNER](http://cbioc.eas.asu.edu/banner/) and the [McClosky-Charniak Parser](http://bllip.cs.brown.edu/resources.shtml) on a PubMed scale.

## Turku Event Extraction System (TEES)

Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) is a free and open source natural language processing system developed for the extraction of events and relations from biomedical text. It is written mostly in Python, and should work in generic Unix/Linux environments.
