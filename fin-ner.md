To run a server version of the tagger locally (in UNIX):

```
git clone https://github.com/spyysalo/keras-bert-ner.git
cd keras-bert-ner/
git submodule init
git submodule update
wget http://dl.turkunlp.org/turku-ner-models/combined-ext-model-130220.tar.gz
tar xvzf combined-ext-model-130220.tar.gz
python3 serve.py --ner_model_dir combined-ext-model
```

and then try

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080?text=Turun+yliopisto
```

or

```
curl -G --data-urlencode "text=Turun yliopisto" http://127.0.0.1:8080
