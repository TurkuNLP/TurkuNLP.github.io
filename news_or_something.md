title: A piece of news, an opinion or something else? Different texts and their detection from the multilingual Internet
---

## Uutinen, mielipide vai jotain muuta? Erilaiset tekstit ja niiden automaattinen tunnistus monikielisestä internetistä

Funded by Emil Aaltonen

The project combines linguistics, natural language processing and machine learning in order to analyse and automatically detect the different text varieties that are used on the internet. By distinguishing between e.g. user manuals, news articles on recent events and texts that also feature the author’s opinion, the project reveals crucial information on language use on the internet and improves the accessibility of the massive amount of information available online. As a practical outcome, the project detects the different text varieties used in a collection of billions of words of online texts written in Finnish, Swedish, French and English that were compiled by the research group during previous research efforts.
