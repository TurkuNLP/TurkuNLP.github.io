## Language Technology study module (25 credits)
Organized together with the Department of Future Technologies and the School of Languages and Translation Studies. No prior knowledge of language technology is needed. Students coming outside the Department of IT will learn the basics of programming and automatic text processing during the first and second period courses so that they are able to continue to more advanced cources. All advanced courses are organized so that motivated students also outside IT Department are able to complete the study module.
